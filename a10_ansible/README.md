# Info about github file trunking
When navigating to the `library` directory, you'll be greeted by this message:
![Github Trunk](/docs/trunc.png)

This message is shown as Github is only able to display 1000 files per page.

The rest of the files may be seen after cloning the repository and navigating to the `library` directory localy.
